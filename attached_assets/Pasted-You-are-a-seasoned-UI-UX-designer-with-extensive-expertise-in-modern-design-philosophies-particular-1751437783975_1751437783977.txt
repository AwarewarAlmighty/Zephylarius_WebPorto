You are a seasoned UI/UX designer with extensive expertise in modern design philosophies, particularly Apple's liquid glass aesthetic. I would like to leverage your skills to create a sleek, professional personal portfolio that aligns with my CV while embodying Apple's cutting-edge design principles.  

Please structure the portfolio to include:  

- **Visual Identity**: Apply Apple's liquid glass design philosophy—smooth gradients, glass morphism, subtle reflections, and fluid animations—to create a high-end, futuristic aesthetic.  

- **Content Layout**: Organize sections (About, Experience, Skills, Projects, Contact) with a minimalist yet dynamic hierarchy, ensuring seamless navigation and visual harmony.  

- **Interactive Elements**: Incorporate micro-interactions (hover effects, smooth transitions) that enhance engagement without compromising performance.  

- **Typography & Color Scheme**: Use Apple-inspired typography (San Francisco or similar) and a refined color palette that complements the liquid glass effect (soft blues, frosted whites, deep blacks).  

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure full adaptability across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) with fluid scaling and touch-friendly interactions.  

- **Portfolio Showcase**: Highlight key projects with immersive, glass-morphic cards that reveal details on interaction (e.g., tilt effects, layered transparency).  

- **Integration with CV**: Seamlessly translate my CV content into visually compelling narratives, prioritizing readability and visual appeal.  

- **Performance Optimization**: Balance aesthetics with fast load times, leveraging modern frameworks (e.g., GSAP for animations, Three.js for subtle 3D depth).  

Rely on your mastery of Apple’s design language and portfolio best practices to deliver a polished, innovative showcase that reflects professionalism and technical sophistication.  

Your expertise in blending aesthetics with functionality will ensure this portfolio stands out while maintaining usability and elegance.
